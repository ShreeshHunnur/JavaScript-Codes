Depending upon how the data is stored in the memory and how it is accessed the datatypes are classified into two types Primitive and Non primitive

Primitive(Call by value) : 7 -types
                          1) String
                          2) Number
                          3) Boolean
                          4) Null
                          5) undefined
                          6) symbol(used for making any value   unique)
                          7) Bigint(large Integers)

Reference/Non primitive Datatypes : 1) Arrays 2) Objects 3) Functions

 Javascript is a Dynamically typed programming language

 There are two types of memory. 1)Stack 2) Heap

 1) Stack is used by prmitive datatypes like string,number,....
    in Stack directly the value is not provided but a copy of the value id provided
    eg : let name = "shreesh"
         let anotherName = name
         here another name is given a copy of name and not directly the value. so if we change the value of anotherName then the value of name will not be changed. This is how stack operates in the primitive datatypes

2) Heap is used by non-primitive datatypes like arrays, objects ....
   in heap directly the reference id provided 
   hence any change in the reference causes the original value to change.
